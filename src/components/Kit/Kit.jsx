                        <p>Dear Students and Parents,</p>

                        <p>Congratulations on securing a seat in one of the many programs at IIIT Hyderabad. IIIT-H is a unique institution where the primary goal of education is not just preparing students for a high-profile first job, but nurturing a mature world-view and a long-term vision. We aim to equip our students with the skills, habits, and attitudes needed for the last job they might take up, decades into the future.</p>

                        <p>As a research university, IIIT-H places a strong emphasis on undergraduate research. It is consistently ranked among the top technology institutes in India, particularly excelling in AI and related areas. We measure our success by the quality of research and the impact we make on society. Our faculty and students work on cutting-edge problems in language translation, speech technologies, robotics, computer vision, VLSI, quantum computing, computational social sciences, and more. Applied research that benefits society directly—through start-ups, technology transfers, and large-scale societal applications—is a major priority here.</p>

                        <p>IIIT-H offers undergraduates an unparalleled opportunity to immerse themselves in research from early on. With options like the B.Tech (Honours) in four years and the integrated five-year MS by Research, you can choose a path that best matches your interests. Our innovative dual-degree programs—combining Computer Science with Natural Sciences, Human Sciences, and Linguistics—are trailblazers in interdisciplinary education in India.</p>

                        <p>At IIIT-H, we value not just academic excellence but also extracurricular growth and self-reflection. Our pioneering Value Education program helps students reflect on their life goals and responsibilities and is now adopted by several other institutions as well.</p>

                        <p>We are committed to making education accessible. Financial support is available to every student in need—through bank loans or alumni-funded pay-forward models—so that financial constraints do not hinder your academic journey.</p>

                        <p>If your ambition is to make a meaningful impact on the world through technology, IIIT-H is the place for you. Be prepared to work hard, think independently, and contribute innovatively. With determination and the right mindset, you will thrive here. This year marks our 25th anniversary, and I’m thrilled to welcome the 26th batch of students to the IIIT-H family!</p>

                        <div className="subsection">
                        <p>Dear Fresher,</p>

                        <p>As a fresher, the greatest fear for most was to walk out of the dear home with familiar faces and walk into a large hall with an unknown visage, as nervous and frightened as you and honestly have no idea what to do next. And that, my friend, is where the magic happens.</p>

                        <p>So, congratulations! You can go and ahead finally put those prep books in your attic now, no need for them anymore! (Well at least not in first year) The fire-breathing dragon that had descended in the form of endless entrance exams, sleepless nights trying to figure out that “last” question, comparisons with the “sharmaji ka beta” and aunties who inquire about your “well-being” all are going to become a distant past. The dragon is now slayed and you are knocking on the doors from where college life starts.</p>

                        <p>The image of clean uniforms, plaited hair and spotless polished black shoes will very soon seem like a distant memory. Once in college, the sheltered lifestyle of schooling will become nearly obsolete, giving way to a courageous, ambitious and conscious individual. Yes, that will be you. This introspection, the consciousness and the courage will not come easy, mind you! It will be gruelling and challenging, as you will be striving to be better than yourself, everyday. That's not a scary thing though. That's what college is meant for.</p>

                        <p>You would often find yourself doing tasks out of your comfort zone, face challenges that initially look intimidating. Whether it’s academic things like doing well in a course, doing research work, competitive coding or exciting internships, or other things like playing sports, writing for the college magazine, dancing for the college fest, creating your own band and performing in November Jam, and so many other fun activities. Explore talents that you never knew you had, and find something that you are really passionate about. Make sure to get a piece of everything the college has to offer. Don’t hold back and try to participate in everything you possibly can. Enjoy these years as much as you can. There is nothing like them. Don’t be afraid to do things because you might fail, but, live and fail often.</p>

                        <p>We, here at IIIT-H, are a tight knit family. Owing to the relatively small size of our community and campus, you will know everyone by name, and will bond with juniors and seniors alike. You will be embark on this journey with your batch mates and seniors, later joined by your own juniors (currently fighting those dragons), while the faculty and professors watch on as guardians, nudging you towards your own path. In this process, you will be part of unbreakable bonds and camaraderie leaving an indelible mark on lives in college. If you feel stuck and lost, there are people at every step willing to help you, reach out to them.</p>

                        <p>We know that you will have many questions, concerns or problems. The institute has constituted a mentoring system, which enables student mentors to assist the freshmen in overcoming any hurdles that they might be experiencing. We have an Apex body of students who, in conjunction with their Faculty guides, will be coordinating with your direct student mentors. Your mentors and us, the Apex Body, are always available for you to contact with any issues throughout the year. If there is anything we can help you or your parents with, it would be our pleasure to do so. Our Email IDs are given below to get in touch with us at any point of time.</p>

                            <p>Taking up a dual degree course with an unheard of MS speciality was perhaps the moment where I decided to cut off from the herd. CND at IIIT is a unique attempt to bridge the amalgamation of Applied Sciences and Computer Science. Aimed at making engineers well versed in the field of biomolecules, theoretical physics and various other domains, CND is a great place for a curious mind.</p>
                            <p>IIIT has been a resourceful cradle for development on a lot of fronts. With a small community I have been able to be a part of various clubs apart from having started one of my own. My experience with IIIT has been laced with a lot of opportunities with a great location in the heart of the city. While there have been troughs through this overwhelming journey and the course has demanded some rigorous hours to be put in, I have definitely been blessed with a broader vision for things.</p>
                            <p>At the end of it all, college will be a universe in itself which will be a great chance for you to follow your instincts and shape yourself as the curriculum develops you academically. You will make buddies for life, learn things you'd least expect and fill up the storyboard of your life.</p>

                            <p>Hey buddy! Congratulations on getting an admission into this college after all your hardwork and those painful exams. Entering from school to college is one of the biggest transitions we all make. Exactly one year ago, when I was looking at the same website, I was extremely curious and puzzled about what college had in store for me.</p>
                            <p>On the day of registration, I walked in with a myriad of questions in mind. But within a week, I stopped feeling lonely and had made so many friends on campus. This place where you're going to stay for the next couple of years has a charm of its own. So, for those of you who will be staying away from home for the first time, you can trust me when I say you'll find a new home here with a family of amazing peers and seniors.</p>
                            <p>Though academics might look stressful in the beginning, you'll fit in the groove as long as you're enthusiastic to learn. Explore different activities with an open mind. Finally, welcome to this place which will witness you improve and grow as a student and person. 🌟</p>

                            <p>Due to its excellent course structure, students are introduced to different aspects of computer science in first two years and get to work on an interesting research problem of their choice in later years.

                            <p>Sadly, there was no "Music Club" on campus when I joined (2014). In my second year I took the responsibility to bring an active music culture to college. And guess what! When I graduated, music club was one of the most active clubs of IIIT.</p>
